Router, route, switch axios




useState
useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value

UseEffect
What does useEffect do? By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.

try catch

async await


django cors headers
middleware

make style

for class Components you can use withStyles instead of makeStyles

Grid
The Material Design responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts. Material Design’s responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout.

Typography
Typography helps design to deliver information to people. Font size, font width, font color, and line lengths — all elements of typography work together to create a great user experience

useParams
Returns an object of the params for the route rendered.
This API requires a hook-compatible version of React.


Object.keys() Method
Object.keys() takes the object as an argument of which the enumerable own properties are to be returned and returns an array of strings that represent all the enumerable properties of the given object.

Input : var object = { 70: 'x', 21: 'y', 35: 'z' };
        console.log(Object.keys(object));
Output : ['21', '35', '70']
